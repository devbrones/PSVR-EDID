# PSVR-EDID
PSVR EDID file for 120Hz non-desktop mode

Many thanks to [gusmanb](https://github.com/gusmanb/PSVRFramework) for the original edid file that added 120Hz and 90Hz modes. I modified it further to report the `0x0704` Product id that is required for the drm module to set the non-desktop quirk.
